# TODO — Ordered Action List

One item per agent session. Commit after each item. Remove completed items. tools and docs moved to VSIXProject1.

## Fork workflow

Source is read from a **local clone of a personal fork** of continuedev/continue.
To update to a newer upstream version:
```
cd <fork-clone-path>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/vX.Y.Z
# resolve conflicts — @ct: cookies on stable lines survive automatically
git push origin
```
Translation annotations (`@ct:` cookies) are placed directly in the fork's TS source and
are version-controlled alongside the code they annotate.

Cookie syntax:
```
// @ct:map=System.Net.Http.HttpClient
// @ct:ignore
// @ct:rename=GetFileContents
// @ct:nuget=System.Net.Http
```
